            British-American violinist Nicholas Cerny is a second-year postgraduate violin student at the Royal College of Music, studying with Daniel Rowland. He recently served as Leader of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik  Festival Orchestra under the direction of Maestro Christoph Eschenbach, leading performances across Germany and Denmark with an orchestra featuring members from over 30 countries. At the RCM, he has served as Associate Leader and Principal Second Violin of the RCM Symphony Orchestra and is a founding member of the Cordelia Quartet, which performs regularly across London. Prior to attending the RCM, Nicholas graduated magna cum laude from Yale University where he simultaneously studied chemistry and music, earning distinction in both subjects as well as the YSEA Award for Outstanding Undergraduate Achievement, and Manzella and Fleischer Prizes.

            However, many participants perceived a degree of what they referred to as “hawkflation” or “groupthink.” Roughly one-fourth 
            of survey respondents noted instances of professional pressure to voice a more hawkish point of view towards China, and many 
            feared being perceived as naive or compromised by their views on, ties to, and experiences in China. These pressures were 
            particularly noteworthy for foreign policy professionals that are traditionally marginalized from power—those who are younger, 
            non-white, or female. Our subjects reported a number of different strategies to cope with these pressures, including mirroring 
            hawkish rhetoric in their advice, modifying or self-censoring their views in public settings, and even exiting the field entirely. 
            Taken together, these social dynamics appear to foster perceptions of “consensus” and bias policy discourse towards hawkish 
            prescriptions and inflated threats.
